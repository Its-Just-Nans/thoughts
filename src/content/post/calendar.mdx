We all know that working with date and calendar can be quite a pain in the neck.

For example, even github doesn't handle correctly the calendar display (https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/74391) - because of leap year starting on sunday.

This tiny library (https://github.com/Its-Just-Nans/go-calendar) can create a svg calendar for you.
