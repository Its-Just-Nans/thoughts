The crème de la crème of English expression

---

I often read english articles and found some treasure in them, here is a non-exhausive list:

-   [the cat's pyjamas](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/the_cat%27s_pyjamas)
-   [under the hood](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/under_the_hood)
-   [top notch](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/top_notch)
-   [wishy-washy](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wishy-washy)
-   [you can't have your cake and eat it too!](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/have_one%27s_cake_and_eat_it_too)
-   [cut your teeth on](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cut_one%27s_teeth)
-   [the lion's share](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lion%27s_share)

Don't worry I will maintain this list!
