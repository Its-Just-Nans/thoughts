A famous sport application which had me really disappointed.

- Has connection issues.

- Always push the user to pay for premium features in the app.

- Auto-stop by default when recording an activity ? Whitout auto-(re)start ?! Really ?!

- Doesn't know how to [use GPS properly](https://n4n5.dev/sportiva/activity/9222545148/).

It's enough for me.

Now launching [Sportiva](https://n4n5.dev/sportiva/) - export your Strava data and view it in a free way (ngl only essentials functions).
