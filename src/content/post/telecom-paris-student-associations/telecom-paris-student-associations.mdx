Student associations are a major part of life at T√©l√©com Paris. Since I started my studies in 2021, I have been involved in several associations. They are a great way to meet new people, learn new things, and have fun, of course!

<Space />

import LogoForumTelecomParis from "./logo_forum.png"

## <CustomImg src={LogoForumTelecomParis}> Forum T√©l√©com Paris</CustomImg>

<Website job={"Member - Website and logistics departments"} >https://forumtelecomparis.fr/</Website>

The "Forum T√©l√©com Paris" association, consisting of around 40 students, organizes an annual recruitment day at T√©l√©com Paris. This was one of the first associations I joined because the mandate starts and ends with the Forum (usually in November). I was in charge of the website and the IT department.

The website was built with Django, PostgreSQL, and Redis. I say "was" because there are a lot of complaints about the difficulty of Django (in fact, it's not difficult; you just need to know a lot about it and spend - too much - time digging into the documentation).

I didn't work much on the website, but I made some useful changes, such as:

- Creating a `docker-compose` file to greatly improve the development experience
- Stopping the use of npm to build the styles and using a simple pythonic library instead

I was also involved in the design and logistics departments. One of my best contributions was updating the logos (I just changed a color - as requested, but now there are [many combinations](https://github.com/Forum-Telecom-Paris/logos/releases)).

<Space />

import LogoRezel from "./logo_rezel.png"

## <CustomImg src={LogoRezel}>Rezel</CustomImg>

<Website job={"Board Member"} >https://rezel.net</Website>

Rezel is an association that provides services for T√©l√©com Paris associations and students (cloud storage, communication, web hosting, etc.).

I have been a member of Rezel since the start of my studies at T√©l√©com Paris, and I was part of the board for the 2022-2023 mandate.

In 2023, Rezel is now officially (again!) an Internet service provider for the students near T√©l√©com Paris: [fai.rezel.net](https://fai.rezel.net/)!

At Rezel, I created a club in honor of the great [Fabrice Bellard](https://bellard.org), named the "Bel Art" Club - founded in January 2022 (`CA_Rezel_2022-01-25`) and ended in September 2023 (`CA_Rezel_2023-09-16`). The club is still alive (really?) here: [bel-art.github.io](https://bel-art.github.io/).

<Space />

import LogoMAD from "./logo_mad.png"

## <CustomImg src={LogoMAD}>MaD - Make a Difference</CustomImg>

<Website job={"Member - Head of the compost division"}>https://mad.telecom-paris.fr</Website>

I was in charge of the compost department at the MaD association (T√©l√©com Paris sustainable development association).

Note that I will always think the current logo is hideous, [I made a better one](https://github.com/Its-Just-Nans/logo-mad) (of course), but they didn't want to change it.

<Space />

import LogoBDA from "./logo_bda.png"

## <CustomImg src={LogoBDA}> BDA - Arts Office - "Bureau Des Arts"</CustomImg>

<Website job={"IT helper"} />

I wasn't heavily involved in the BDA, but I created a website (a tiny landing page) and a logo animation for them.

<Space />

import LogoKFT from "./logo_kft.png"

## <CustomImg src={LogoKFT}>KFT</CustomImg>

<Website job={"Member - 'Micka√´l Mazars' division"}>https://kft.telecom-paris.fr</Website>

KFT stands for "Kebab Factory T√©l√©com," so you can easily understand what it's about. This association creates events where everybody can enjoy a great time and savor a delightful kebab! ü•ôüòã

Legend says that Micka√´l Mazars was once the best man and savior of KFT and I took his place!

My actions in KFT included maintaining the website (and doing a little rewrite). I also happened to fix some equipment!

Website: [kft.telecom-paris.fr](https://kft.telecom-paris.fr)

import LogoTelecomEtude from "./logo_telecom_etude.png"

## <CustomImg src={LogoTelecomEtude}> Telecom Etude - The Junior Enterprise of T√©l√©com Paris</CustomImg>

<Website job={"Member (JET) - IT division"}>https://telecom-etude.fr</Website>

Telecom Etude, the [junior enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_enterprise) specializing in new technologies, has over 42 years of experience in various fields!

Telecom Etude is one of the most serious associations, which is quite normal because it acts like a company (recruiting people for missions).

My principal mission was to create a new, clean website (from scratch). As it is mostly a static website, I used [Astro](https://astro.build) to generate the pages. Note that the repo is mostly public: [github.com/telecom-etude/website](https://github.com/telecom-etude/website)!

I also participated as a developer for a mission (more info [here](https://n4n5.dev/history/telecom-etude-mission/)).

Do you have a project? Contact Telecom Etude here: [telecom-etude.fr](https://telecom-etude.fr)

<Space />

import LogoTelecomBusinessAndFinance from "./logo_telecom_business_finance.png"

## <CustomImg src={LogoTelecomBusinessAndFinance}>TBF - T√©l√©com Business and Finance</CustomImg>

<Website>https://telecom-business-finance.com</Website>

Was I in TBF? No. Did I take some pictures for them? Yes.

<Space />

import LogoBDS from "./logo_bds.png"

## <CustomImg src={LogoBDS}>BDS - Sports Office - "Bureau Des Sports"</CustomImg>

<Website job={"Member - Medias and IT divisions"}>https://bds-telecom-paris.fr</Website>

My role in the BDS was to create the website and manage media coverage (photo and video) of events.

A legend says that the BDS and websites are not friendly because every year the team decides to change the website.

On my side, the old website wasn't working anymore, so I created a new one using Node.js, Svelte, and MongoDB. I even created pull requests to npm packages to update some open source packages I used! But as the legend says, the new team decided to just do another website - and you can't really do anything about it.

<Space />

import LogoTSM from "./logo_tsm.png"

## <CustomImg src={LogoTSM}>TSM - T√©l√©com Sound & Magic</CustomImg>

<Website job={"Member"}>https://tsm-tp.fr</Website>

TSM is the DJ, sound, and lights association of T√©l√©com Paris. TSM also provides services!

Boom boom in the ears!

<Space />

import LogoSnax from "./logo_snax.png"

## <CustomImg src={LogoSnax}>Snax</CustomImg>

<Website job={"Director/Head of website department"}>https://snax.rezel.net</Website>

Snax is the legendary club with countless departments.

To enter it, you need to create a new department and pursue a related quest. Mine was to create the website department by launching the Snax website [snax.rezel.net](https://snax.rezel.net) (try to count departments - not really updated anymore).

<Space />

import LogoComete from "./logo_comete.png"

## <CustomImg src={LogoComete}>Com√®te</CustomImg>

<Website job={"Board member - IT and Equipment Manager"}>https://comete-tp.fr</Website>

Com√®te is an audiovisual and communication association (some say it's the best association at T√©l√©com Paris).

I was responsible for:
- The IT department (maintaining the website and creating an archiving system)
- The equipment

Did you know Com√®te produces approximately 2+TB of data per year (videos, photos, etc.)?!

Com√®te also undertakes missions to cover certain events! Contact us at [comete-tp.fr](https://comete-tp.fr)

<Space />

import LogoLH from "./logo_lh.png"

## <CustomImg src={LogoLH}>LH - Weekly Letter - "Lettre Hebdomadaire"</CustomImg>

<Website job={"IT Helper"}>https://lh.rezel.net</Website>

I don't really know if I could say I'm part of the LH, but if this [major thing](https://github.com/lettre-hebdomadaire/lettre-hebdomadaire.github.io/pull/5) exists (thanks to [Astro](https://astro.build)), I guess we can say so. Thanks to solid fellows who resurrected the LH (yes, it died several times - long story), we now have a solid editorial team (weekly memes are unmatched - thanks for that).

In the beginning, the LH was in paper format and you can find some remnants if you dig in the right places at T√©l√©com! Nowadays it has been digitalized and you can read it online ([auto-deployed from the repo](https://github.com/lettre-hebdomadaire/lettre-hebdomadaire.github.io/actions) sirü´°): [link to github repo](https://github.com/lettre-hebdomadaire/lettre-hebdomadaire.github.io).

## General Good Practices

Here are some good practices I have learned during my time in associations:

- This repo could be useful for future years https://bel-art.github.io/telecom-logos/ (if it's maintained)
- If the association keeps your work, think about how you would like future people to see it: documentation and explanation, date, the five [5 Ws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws)
- Always date the work, outside (name of file) and inside (in the corner on a poster, by mentioning it in the video, etc.). It's a little thing, but it's important.
- Remember that now we save a lot of things with technology (which wasn't the case before, that's why we don't have a lot of association archives), so it's important to keep a trace of what has been done, noting what worked and what didn't.
- Help and take the time to explain to others (and next) members and always ask if they understand what you are explaining.
- Appreciate your work, you did it, be proud of it.

You can find more information about associations and more on the [CHAT](https://chat.rezel.net) ("chat" means "cat" but the initials of "CHAT" stand for "Conservation of the Associative History of T√©l√©com").
