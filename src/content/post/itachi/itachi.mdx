###  *(ðŸŽµ Intro - Whispered Thought ðŸŽµ)*

*"The village first, that was my creed...*

*But to keep it safe, I had to bleed...*

*Walked this path, no turning back...*

*Buried my heart in the cold and black..."*


### **(Verse 1 - Young Prodigy)**

Born in the war where the steel blades clashed,

Blood in the dirt, bodies turn to ash.

Eyes saw death at the age of four,

Felt like fate had locked that door.

<br />

Six years old, I was moving fast,

Chunin rank, left 'em all in the past.

Father said, "Boy, you were born to lead,"

But my heart was torn, wasn't sure I agreed.

<br />

I studied the truth, saw the way they lied,

Peace and war, just a thin divide.

The village fights just to stay alive,

But inside the walls, there's a war to hide.


### **(Chorus - Cursed Path)**

**Took the pain, took the fall,**

**Silent blade, I lost it all.**

**Did it all so the flames don't rise,**

**Lived in the dark for the village to shine.**


### **(Verse 2 - The Uchiha Coup)**

Whispers spoke of a rebel plan,

Uchiha rise, take back the land.

Father and kin, they sharpened steel,

But they never saw the fate was sealed.

<br/>

Danzo came with a deadly deal,

"Save the Leaf or the clan gets killed."

Torn in half, had to make my move,

Chose my fate, nothing left to prove.

<br/>

Midnight struck, had to end the fight,

Shadows danced in the pale moonlight.

Steel met flesh, felt my soul decay,

But the village stood at the break of day.

### **(Chorus - Cursed Path)**

**Took the pain, took the fall,**

**Silent blade, I lost it all.**

**Did it all so the flames don't rise,**

**Lived in the dark for the village to shine.**


### **(Verse 3 - The Cost of Truth)**

Left my home, but I watched it still,

Kept my hands dirty so they wouldn't kill.

Akatsuki cloak with the crimson sky,

Played my role, fed them lies.

<br/>

Inside, I knew that my time was short,

Illness creeping, couldn't fight that war.

Had to face my brother, make him hate,

Push him far, twist his fate.

<br/>

Final fight, yeah, I let him win,

Blood in my mouth, but I cracked a grin.

Truth stayed locked, never let it show,

Gave my life so the flames still glow.


## (Verse 4 - Akatsuki's Shadow)

Red clouds drift in a stormy haze,

Walking with ghosts through the killing days.

Silent moves in a viper's den,

Spied on the snakes, called them friends.

<br/>

Pain had a vision, his words ran deep,

Spoke of a world where the weak don't weep.

But darkness breeds when the blind lead blind,

So I played my hand, stayed confined.

<br/>

Kisame rode where my footsteps led,

Loyal to death, yeah, he knew my dread.

Through every war, through every sin,

I walked that road, never let them win.

### **(Outro - Eternal Will)**

**No name on a stone, just a ghost in the past,**

**But the Will of Fire will always last.**

**Shadows walk where the heroes fall,**

**But peace was worth itâ€”after all.**

<br/>

*(Final Whisper)*

*"Forgive me, Sasukeâ€¦"*
