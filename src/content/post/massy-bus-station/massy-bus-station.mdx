Massy bus station has a problem: it unnecessarily forces users to take stairs to access the bus station. While climbing stairs is beneficial for health, it is not ideal for individuals with reduced mobility, heavy luggage, or strollers. The lift, often proposed as a solution, is frequently out of service, rendering it unreliable.

The biggest problemâ€”and the one that's hardest to understandâ€”is the change in the bus rotation. This change fundamentally altered the entire design and functionality of the bus station, yet it brought no clear benefits.

By switching from a counterclockwise to a clockwise rotation, the station's layout became less intuitive and more confusing for both regular users and newcomers. The new design disrupted pedestrian flow, reduced accessibility, and introduced unnecessary obstacles like the mandatory use of the footbridge. These changes not only fail to improve the user experience but actively make the station less practical for everyone, especially those with mobility challenges.

Apparently, the final project will look like this, featuring an extremely long footbridge ðŸ˜Ÿ. I can only hope that pedestrians will be allowed to walk freely and not be forced to use the footbridge. However, if that happens, pedestrians will face the risk of walking near buses, which is far from ideal.

I also hope the final project includes a new bicycle lane, as the current setup leaves cyclists without a safe and dedicated space, forcing them to share the road with buses and other vehicles.
