This following post is a follow-up of [this post](https://thoughts.n4n5.dev/cv-integration).

My CV is now built from a JSON file and the [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) integration in `lualatex`

A little lua script reads the JSON and generates the CV with the data. The Layout is hardcoded in the script.

repo is here: https://github.com/Its-Just-Nans/curriculum-vitae

yes, my cv is now a json file (+ a picture if needed).

## Edit 2024-11

the script is now single-file and self invoking itself inside `lualatex`

`how *fun* ?`
