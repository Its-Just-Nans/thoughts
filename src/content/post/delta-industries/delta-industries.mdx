Creation of a tiny CMS website for *Delta Industries* using PHP, SQL and JavaScript ([Three.js](https://threejs.org/))

Three.js was used to modelize 3D pieces by the user.

Worked with :

- PHP
- SQL
- Javascript
- ThreeJS

They really needed a portfolio website (with a good SEO) but they wanted to have a 3D model of their pieces. So I used Three.js to create a 3D model of their pieces.
